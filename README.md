This is a simple Cafe Information Webpage using HTML and CSS.The purpose of this task was to design a single-page website that includes a Header, Main, Footer, Table and Form. The page showing menu highlights, opening hours and contact/order for vistors.
First, I created the project folder and four type of files. They are index.html, style.css, README.md and .gitignore.
Then, I started with basic HTML structure includes !DOCTYP, head, main and footer.
In header, I added the cafe name and navigator to identify the link by css.
In main, I divided into multiparts for second section, menu, hours and input field to give the order in textarea. Then submit button.
Then the footer part there i added my contact details.

I linked my HTML file in CSS  by using link.
Then I make sure my files in same folder.Then I applied styles for header, main, button, tables,forms and footer.
I tested and previewed my output and committed my files to GITHUB my every stage of finishing. Then i pust it on my remote repo.
